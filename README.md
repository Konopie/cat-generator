# Cat Generator

## Project Description
The purpose of this group project was to create a front-end web application using a CSS framework other than Bootstrap that is interactive (accedpting and responding to user input), utilizes at least two server-side APIs, uses client-side storage to store persistent data, and has a polised user interface.  

We decided to make something fun that would be interesting for cat fans to peruse to see entertaining images, videos, and gifs about cats along with random cat facts. 

User Story: AS A dog lover married to a cat lover....I WANT TO learn facts about cats and view funny images of cats....SO THAT I can learn to love cats as much as my partner loves cats.

### APIs
We used "The Cat API" for the images on our application. https://apilist.fun/api/the-cat-api
We used "Cat Facts API" for the facts. https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/?ref=apilist.fun

### CSS Framework
Bulma is a free open-source CSS framework that is designed for mobile first and built with flexbox. It is a beginner-friendly framework with documentation that is easy to understand.

### Client-Side Storage
We utilized favorte (star) buttons. The user can store one favorite fact and one favorite picture in the favorites local storage container at the bottom of the page.
